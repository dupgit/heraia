	The heraia program has now a new plugin interface. It has been proved
	that this interface is fully functionnal. It lacks already a number
	of features that may be interesting in the future :
		- ability to configure a plugin within the Plugin list window
		- some functions to use filtering easyly
		- some functions to import / export files (templates files)
		- a safe multithreaded interface (there is many things that
                  renders plugin multithreading unusable or unsafe at least)
		- add command lines options to disable some plugins
	
	Since one year there is few changes in the main interface :
		- added a log window
		- added a plugin system

	But there has been a lot of changes in the code itself in order to
	bring back coherence (if there was any before !!).

	There is many still many things to do and the most important one is 
	probably the GtkHexWidget replacement as it contains too many
	limitations :
		- Size of files that may be openned : < 2Go
		- Does not use a cache system. The openned file is opened
		  entirely (this is very long for a 650Mo iso file for
		  example).

	We may also add the following :
		- ability to open more than one file at a time
		- ability to filter a selection (select a compressed zone
		  send it to the right decompressor and edit the new stream
		  for exemple)
		- add a search tool (that may search for templates)
		- add a template creator
		- multi - system compilation (windows, mac os, hp-ux, ...)
		- ... 

	This is only the beginning guys ... come on, help the heraia project
	by :
		- coding something of the above
		- writing help, translating the application
		- coding a plugin (which may (or not) be usefull)
		- coding import / export filters
		- codind stream filters
		- using the product and saying your opinion about it,
		  the features you may want to see added, ...

	Héraia is not meant to be an hexadecimal document creator thus it is
	not possible to call heraia from the command line with a file that does
        not exists or that has a length of 0 byte.

	Project creation
	Name of the project comes from 
	http://www.educnet.education.fr/musagora/manuel/sequence4/tradHeraia.htm
	(french)
	This is my first project in gtk+ so there might be surprising things for
        one used to it. Please report anything that seems strange to you.
