    Ok, I'm not very serious and forgot to write here...
    Now libheraia is a real library and thus this is possible to have bindings
    for python...

    I'm trying to change the user's experience by adding some classical
    functions such as warning when leaving without saving, copy/cut undo/redo
    and so on...

    Translation is in progress. I hope that this will be achieved soon.

    I forgot to write here for a while !
    I recently added a roadmap file in order to know where to go. This is
    because Isabelle Hurbain (a friend of mine) told me that I have to
    release early and often. Before that I was considering each svn version
    as a "release" itself.
    Now one can contribute freely for the next release.

    Thanks to Sebastien Tricaud there is also a new branche that creates
    python bindings and a libheraia library which anyone could use in their
    projects (I don't know who will use this, no one is even using the main
    program !!). Anyway this is long term interest. I hope Sebastien will
    take care of that branche and thus it might merge with the "official"
    one soon.

    The heraia program has now a new plugin interface. It has been proved
    that this interface is fully functionnal. It lacks already a number
    of features that may be interesting in the future :
        - ability to configure a plugin within the Plugin list window
        - some functions to use filtering easyly
        - some functions to import / export files (templates files)
        - a safe multithreaded interface (there is many things that
                  renders plugin multithreading unusable or unsafe at least)
        - add command lines options to disable some plugins

    Since one year there is few changes in the main interface :
        - added a log window
        - added a plugin system

    But there has been a lot of changes in the code itself in order to
    bring back coherence (if there was any before !!).

    There is many still many things to do and the most important one is
    probably the GtkHexWidget replacement as it contains too many
    limitations :
        - Size of files that may be openned : < 2Go
        - Does not use a cache system. The openned file is opened
          entirely (this is very long for a 650Mo iso file for
          example).

    We may also add the following :
        - ability to open more than one file at a time
        - ability to filter a selection (select a compressed zone
          send it to the right decompressor and edit the new stream
          for exemple)
        - add a search tool (that may search for templates)
        - add a template creator
        - multi - system compilation (windows, mac os, hp-ux, ...)
        - ...

    This is only the beginning guys ... come on, help the heraia project
    by :
        - coding something of the above
        - writing help, translating the application
        - coding a plugin (which may (or not) be usefull)
        - coding import / export filters
        - codind stream filters
        - using the product and saying your opinion about it,
          the features you may want to see added, ...

    Héraia is not meant to be an hexadecimal document creator thus it is
    not possible to call heraia from the command line with a file that does
    not exists or that has a length of 0 byte.

    Project creation
    Name of the project comes from
    http://www.educnet.education.fr/musagora/manuel/sequence4/tradHeraia.htm
    (french)
    This is my first project in gtk+ so there might be surprising things for
    one used to it. Please report anything that seems strange to you.
