		document structure in the array.

26.04.2009

04.03.2009
    - Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
      * one may remember that "due to historical reasons, GtkNotebook refuses to 
		switch to a page unless the child widget is visible. Therefore, it is 
        recommended to show child widgets before adding them to a notebook." !!

      * Validated the new way to manage data interpretor's tab system.

      * loading preference file may happen when everything has been initialized.

28.02.2009
    - Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
      * I simplified too much the decoding part and this would have be a problem
	    when we will had external data types, advanced search capabilities and
	    such.
      * Trying to add more flexibility to data interpretor window (this work is
        in ultra bleeding edge stage - do not rely on any strcuture for now)

23.02.2009
    - Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
      * Modifing structures in decode.c and decode.h to have a unified way to
        call decoding functions in order to ease new structures to be added
        Removing thing that we do not need any more -> simpler is better
        Removing unnecessary doxygen structures (because we do comment functions
        above the functions themselves)
      * Deleted the menu in data_interpretor window as this is more confusing 
        than anything else.

21.02.2009

    - Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
      * Begun work on data_interpretor stuff that will ease, in the future,
        writing of new data types. I hope this to be usefull when I'll add
        a scripting language in heraia or something similar to "create" new 
        data types.

18.02.2009

    * Added a preference menu (still not activated)
    * Commented out some exit() commands when logging errors, fatals or
      recursion
    * Changed things a bit in the about box in order that heraia could
      compile even if gtk's version is < 2.12

11.08.2008
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Now plugin_list, main_window and list data types properties are

 	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* A propos changes :
      - renamed a function to have coherence between a_propos functions
      - added the PACKAGE_VERSION config variable in order to avoid to have
        to modify the .glade file at each version.
    * translated some french strings in the stat plugin window
    * added some info bubbles to comment the 1D and 2D options

	    and to calculate the result
	  - added one simple treatment as un example : "reverse" that
	    reverse the bytes in the buffers
	  - added the just created data types a special user defined
	    tab in the data interpretor window
	  - added a refresh caller that refreshes the user defined
	    type tab if one moves the cursor around in the hex editor
	* Moved treatments definitions to heraia_type.h
	* Reviewed gmalloc allocations

26.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Added treatments.[ch] where one should find all treatments
	  definitions that may be used in new data type definitions in
	  the data_type window.

23.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Added structures and functions to manage the treatment
	  container where treatments will appear

22.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Added a wrapper to the function glade_xml_get_widget in
	  order to be able to change the method (or add a user choice
	  about the method or library), thinking about GtkBuilder

21.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Activating debug, by default in file "configure.ac"
	  and turning back the option correctly in heraia.c
	* Added -ggdb flag to debugging option in file "configure.ac"
	* Added a new structure to handle XML definitions loaded at
	  runtime: xmls that will group all GladeXML definitions
	  Modified all the sources accordingly

13.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Added comments
	* Changed few things in configure.ac
	* Begun the data type and list data type windows. Here we should
	  find a way to add new types (that will be used in the data
	  interpretor window)

12.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Could not find a way to compile plugins under windows.
	  Unresolved errors like "undefined symbol" occurs where
	  they do not under my linux box (debian etch).

09.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Use of $(LDFLAG) varaible in Makefile.am this will be more
	  convenient if we want to change things : we might do so only
	  in configure.ac file.

08.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Changed heraia's behavior when called to allow the user to
	  call without a filename in the command line (but the option
	  to do so is not removed)
	* Added more comments and removed old commented out functions
	* Re-added the fact that the file chooser 'remembers' the last
	  openned directory
	* Modified the init_location_list in order that this fucntion
	  returns a GList of locations and does not take any arguments

07.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Changed the way to call the log function for debug purposes.
	  Now you can call directly (without testing main_window->debug)
	  the 'log_message' function with G_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG parameter.
	* Modified some functions in order that their McCabe complexity
	  number be strictly under 10.
	* Translated some french sentences to english.
	* Data interpretor notebook tab now remembers the last opened
	  tab (in order to display this one when re-opening it)
	* Switched from file selection to file chooser

06.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Added --enable-debug, --enable-gcov and --enable-gprof options
	  to ./configure's script
	  - enable-debug sets the PROGRAM_DEBUG environment variable to
	    TRUE and compiles heraia with debugging mode on, otherwise
	    heraia is compiled without debugging mode. As for now, as I
	    consider the code as not mature, heraia is compiled in
	    debugging mode (whatever the option you choose)
	  - enable-gcov enables code coverage functionnalities used by
	    gnu's gcov software (it may help to see how well is tested
	    a particular piece of code)
	  - enable-gprof enables code performances analysis. It may be
	    a little bit useless at first, but it may become interesting
	    in the future (when some search functions will be available)

03.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Corrected some comments


02.11.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* moved connect_cursor_moved_signal function from
	  ghex_heraia_interface.c to heraia_ui.h to be
	  more coherent.
	* adding a new window that will allow the user to
	  create new data types (that may be viewed in the
	  data interpretor window) added the files
	   . list_data_types.[ch]
	* Moved the connection to the moved cursor's signal
	  from heraia.c to init_heraia_interface() in the
	  heraia_ui.c file. Added in load_heraia_ui()  a call
	  to list_data_types_init_interface() function.
	* Moved some signals connections to the data interpretor
	  window from init_heraia_interface() to
	  connect_data_interpretor_signals()
	* Added a return value to
	  gtk_radio_button_get_active_from_widget() in case
	  of a null radio_group_member (returns NULL)


30.10.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Changed the "Base" tab name to "Binary based"
	  name.
	* Added HFS as a new interpreted date
	* Added BCD coding to the "Binary based" tab
	* Added links to the "links" file to document
	  dates formats and some interresting projects
	* Redesigned a bit the functions that computes
	  the date and time
	* Added middle endian encoding
	* Added logos to the main window and the about
	  box

24.10.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Get rid of the old data interpretor window and :
	  - added a new one in the glade description file
	    that uses tabs (numbers, dates and base)
	  - modified a bit to take this major change into
	    account. Now adding a new function to decode
	    things and linking it to the data interpretor
	    window is much more easy.
	  - Added a binary interpretation into the "base"
	    tab.
	  - cleaned code and comments a bit
	* added a link for the endianness documentation

11.07.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>

	  . new file added. This file describes an InnoSetup project
	    that make a win32 setup binary for heraia.

26.06.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* plugins/stat/stats.c
	  . still making some efforts on color normalisation
	  . suppressed an unecessary function parameter that
	    we can have with the other one
	  . added some textual informations about the histograms
	  . added some space between the textual informations
	    in the hope that it will add lisibility

25.06.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* plugins/stat/Makefile.am
	  . added some libs for the linker (supprisingly windows needs this
	    were linux doesn't even bother !)
	* plugins/stat/stat.c
	  . added a info structure to store min, max, mean and the number of
	    different values (and may be some other statistical values in
	    the future) in order to draw better histograms (some day).
	  . changed two functions to made the calculation of thoses values
	    for histo 1D and 2D.
	  . optimized things by doing a double loop only once.
	  . tried to change the normalization calculation (still to be
	    improved !!)
	* configure.ac
	  . added the src dir for the linker (same reason)
	* Makefile.am
	  . added autogen.sh and autoclean to the dist files. Thoses files
	    are usefull tools that I uses everyday. There is no valuable
	    reason that others won't !
	* ChangeLog
	  . corrected a typo !!!

24.06.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* plugins/stat/stat.c
	  . added a "save as" button to the stat plugin

	  . changed a g_strdup_printf into a more portable g_build_filename

18.06.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* renamed the following files (some stupid system are unable to
	  compile heraia otherwise) :
	  . io.c -> heraia_io.c
	  . io.h -> heraia_io.h
	  . types.h -> heraia_types.h
	  . heraia-errors.h -> heraia_errors.h
	  . changed Makefile.am and relevant .c files to reflect this.


17.06.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* stat.[ch] :
	  . added the histogram 1D and 2D visualisation (generating an image)
	    with a GdkPixbuf (Still doesn't work)
	  . killed the #include directives (now all is included in types.h)
	* types.h :
	  . killed an unecessary commented out line (graph analysis)

15.06.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* heraia_ui.c :
	  . added some code in order that the about dialog box can close
	    correctly under windows (that is to say by pressing the "close"
	    button!)

14.06.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Still some changes to enable easy compilation under the
	  mingw/msys environment under Windows.
	  . modified nearly all files to put, in the file type.h all the
	    decalaratives part in order that the linker under windows may
	    not be confused (which is the case even if you specify hard
	    coded paths to the .o files!)
	  . suppressed some trailing '/' to the end of SRCDIR and TOP_SRCDIR
	    in order that the path is really included by the compiler (gcc)
	    under windows (I do not know why there is such a difference with
	    the linux environment which does not complain at all !!)

12.06.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* Changes to prepare heraia to be compiled on windows :
	  . added the -mno-cygwin flag to CFLAGS. So the executable is made
	    standalone.
	  . added SRCDIR and TOP_SRCDIR definition in configure.ac and
	    replaced the old srcdir and top_srcdir by those variables
	    in the Makefiles.am in order to take paths correctly under
	    windows
	  . modified the AC_OUTPUT command with a AC_CONFIG_FILE because
	    it's smarter !
	* heraia.c :
	  . added and changed some comments
	  . changed the hardcoded paths with the glib equivalent functions
	    in order that the software still works in an environment where
	    paths can begin with C: or F: and so on ...
	* plugin.c :
	  . changed a g_strdup_printf in a g_build_filename in order that
	    the filename is built correctly even if we are under windows !

20.01.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* corrected some mistakes about freeing thinks (trying some code in
	  some less tolerant system is good finaly !)
	* changed the default display value for the data_interpretor window
	* deleted the unnecessary code from graph_analysis.[ch] which will
	  be transferred to the stat plugin

17.01.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* modified 'plugin/stat/Makefile.am', 'src/Makefile.am' to make 'make
	  dist' be functional.
	* added 'ghex_file_size' function to access the GtkHex structure
	  directly only in the 'ghex_heraia_interface.c'

15.01.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>

	* added 'plugin_list.c' and 'plugin_list.h'
	* modified 'Makefile.am'
	* added some generic code to add text and kill text from a textview in
	  'heraia_ui.c' and 'heraia_ui.h'
	* Modified 'README' a bit
	* removed the gboolean loaded of the plugin structure and replace with
	  a PluginState state one.
	* plugins/stat/stat.c modified to reflect the above change

07.01.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* added an 'event' gint to the main structure heraia_window_t in order
	  that the plugins know what event called there refresh_proc function
	  (new file, cursor move). Such events may be added in the future.
	  note : this is where is located the main reason making the plugin
	  	 system unable to instantly become multi-threaded (some
		 hard work will be needed)
	* Change the default location for *.glade's' file to be found to
	  /usr/local/share/heraia/

	  function (heraia_ui.c)


05.01.2007
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	* begining the work on the plugins capacities
	* added 'plugins' subdir to the project

14.05.2005
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	  * src/heraia.c
	    made filename argument optional. If file does not exists, an empty
	    hexdocument is created.

	  * src/data_interpretor.c and src/decode.c and src/include/decode.h
	    . added decode_8bits_signed and decode_8bits_unsigned functions.
	    . modified the interpret_signed_byte and interpret_unsigned_byte to

	      to resize when nothing was displayed in the data_interpretor
	      window.
	    . added a font selector dialog box that allows one to change the
	      font used by the data_interpretor window to display things.

05.05.2005
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	  uploaded the new web site designed by gretsim

05.04.2005
        - Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	  Upon suggestion from Sebastien Tricaud, changed the struct names :
	    . lowercase
	    . get rid of _Struct and replaced it by a _t

	  * src/include/data_interpretor.h
	    . added a 'current_hexwidget' pointer to the main structure in order
	      to know which hexwidget we are interpreting datas (a first step
	      to an MDI driven application!).

	  * src/decode.c
	    . cleaned the code
	    . At least we have now a decode_dos_date function that retrieves
	      the right date !

	  * src/ghex_heraia_interface.c
	    . cleaned the code and added a big_endian parameter to the
	      ghex_memcpy function.

	  * src/data_interpretor.c
	    . cleaned the code
	    . added an 'encoding' menu with a Big Endian menu item. By default
	      all documents are viewed in a little endian manner.
	    . changed all calls to catch the new 'current_hexwidget' pointer
	      in the 'data_window_t' structure.
	    . modified the call to the data_interpret initialisation function.

	  * src/heraia.c
	    . get the signal handling to refresh the data_interpretor here

	  * docs/links
	    . added a french link to an endianness explanation at debian.org
	      that worth the reading time.



03.04.2005
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	  * src/data_interpretor.c and src/include/data_interpretor.h
	    . modified the Data_Window_Struct to add a menubar and a menu
	    . deleted the previous display_xxx vars
	    . modified the code to add that menu. Now you can choose what you
	      want to display. By default, 32 and 64 bits are not displayed.

	  * src/decode.c and src/include/decode.h
	    modified the decode_dos_date : added the date_and_time structure
	    and also changed things in order to calculate the date correctly.
	    This need some testing and improvements.

	  * heraia.csv
	    This is a new file that contains the following fields separated by
	    tabs :
	    filename, size, md5, sha1, ripemd160

29.03.2005
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
          * src/decode.c and src/include/decode.h
	    . added a date_and_time structure
	      functions decode_filetime_date and decode_C_date now takes
	      this structure as an argument. This will make things easier
	      for the search capabilities still to add to heraia ;)
	    . At least the C dates and filetime dates are now Ok.
	      Still todo : dos date.

	   * src/data_interpretor.c
	     changed the calls to decode_filetime_date and decode_C_date
	     to reflect the changes in decode.c

	  * autoclean
	    added a line to suppress all *~ files (generated by emacs)

26.03.2005

	 * src/include/data_interpretor.h
	    . modified the Data_Window_Struct to add display settings
	    . removed the label_offset and entry_offset
	    . added a window_statusbar and a statusbar_context

	 * src/decode.c and src/include/decode.h
	    . added a decode_C_date function

24.03.2005

	  * src/decode.c : added a decode_filetime_date function
	  * src/data_interpretor.c : added a interpret_filetime_date function
	  * docs/test_file : a test file that contains filetime dates and whose
	    aim is to provide data tests from the test-suite.
	  * docs/links : updated that file with one link

15.03.2005
	- Olivier Delhomme <heraia@delhomme.org>
	  * src/decode.c file: here we should put all the stuff to decode and
	    interpret data.
	  * src/include/decode.h created.
	  * src/ghex_heraia_interface.c file : here we should put all the stuff
	    we need to communicate with the ghex widget.

	    to make the whole stuff working.

14.03.2005
	- Gregory Audet <gretsim@yahoo.com>
	  * web site patchs :
	    . Text region  is larger
	    . We now have a title
