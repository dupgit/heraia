What is heraia ?
================

Heraia is free software licensed under the GPLv2 or later. It is a standalone
hexadecimal file analyser. One would say hexadecimal editor. It provides tools
to analyse and edit files in an hexadecimal way. It contains :

  . a fully functional plugin system
  . an extensible data interpretor

It is written in C using GTK and based on GtkHex Widget. It is known to run on
many systems 32 or 64 bits (Ubuntu 10.04, Debian squeeze, Fedora 12 (used to
work on windows XP). As it is based on GtkBuilder, minimum version of Gtk is
2.16 (so it won't work on Centos 5 or RHEL 5). It integrates smoothly with
Gnome but it does not depend on it.
