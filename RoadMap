Heraia's version roadmap.

I consider a minor release as a cumulative number of micro releases. So the
functions I need for 0.1.0 will be done in 0.0.x micro releases. I expect
functions to be tested for a micro release and more tested for a minor release,
I let you imagine what I expect before I do a major release !!!
