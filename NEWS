11.05.2010 New version 0.1.2 with minor changes :
            - heraia now ask the user if an unsaved modified document still
              exists
            - selection (start and end) and selection size ar now displayed
            - filename in tab's notebook are blue when a change has occured and
              returns to black when saved
            - internationalisation is in progress

05.04.2010 New version 0.1.1 with major changes :
            - requires GTK > 2.16 because everything is now passed to GtkBuilder
            - added new option -t --tests to allow tests executions (for the
              code itself).
            - added a new submenu that will allow to test the UI (I hope)
            - Aurelie DERAISME added transparency to the logo which is now
              really fancier than it was (generated it at all sizes from 16x16
              to 128x128)
            - deleted all unused code (data_types and treatements...).
            - modified the way the library is compiled in order to be able to
              use it directly into python (added a first test in a sub-directory
              to be sure that it works).
            - code refactoring especially to add some coherence and avoid
              variable names that may be confusing
            - some code coverage has been done
            - and of course numerous bug corrections

07.11.2007 I tried to minimise McCabe's complexity measure results
           of every function. I would be very pleased if heraia
           developpers, if any, could be carefull enought to leave
           each function's McCabe value under 10 strictly.
