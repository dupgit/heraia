To build heraia you need to install the following packages and all their
dependencies before (according that you have a default installation) :

On ubuntu 10.04 and Debian squeeze :

 . gcc
 . make
 . intltool
 . libglib2.0-dev
 . libgtk2.0-dev
 . libgtkhex0-dev

On OpenSuse 11.3 and Fedora 14 :

 . gcc
 . make
 . intltool
 . glib2-devel
 . gtk2-devel
 . ghex-devel

On OpenIndiana 5.11 :

 . gcc-3
 . gettext
 . gnu-gettext
 . ghex


Compiling :
---------

Compiling the program if you have the svn sources (the easy way)

 ./autoclean.sh
 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make -s

Optional (system installation) :
 sudo make install

Now you can run the program (filename is a file of your own choice, for
instance src/heraia :) :
 src/heraia filename

If you have installed it :
 heraia filename

Please note :
If you downloaded the sources from the svn repository the
file heraia.csv does not mean anything (as it is not generated
for every commit - but only for distribution packages upon new
versions).

And also, if you have any question regarding heraia, please e-mail me at
heraia@delhomme.org


***** Reminder for code coverage *****

Code coverage and profiling tests do the following :
 ./configure --enable-gcov --enable-gprof --enable-debug
 make
 ./src/heraia src/heraia

Then do whatever you want with the program (eg. test the functions you
need to) and (assuming you are in the trunk directory) :

 lcov -c -o ../../coverage/coverage.info --directory=./
 cd ../../coverage
 genhtml coverage.info

open index.html generated file with your favorite web browser, and you're done.


***** Reminder for developpers *****

For a release do not forget to :

 - change configure.ac version number
 - heraia.h version number and date
 - heraia.c doxygen comment version number
 - generate the doxygen documentation in the docs directory. Edit
   heraia.doxygen file to reflect version number and directories (basicaly
   lines PROJECT_NUMBER and OUTPUT_DIRECTORY).
   Execute "./make_devel_docs.sh"
   make a tar.gz available in the download directory (as for sources)
 - generate code coverage tests
