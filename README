Compiling the program (the easy way)

 ./autoclean.sh
 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make

Optional :
 sudo make install

Now you can run the program : 
 src/heraia filename

If you have installed it : 
 heraia filename

Please note :
If you downloaded the sources from the svn repository the
file heraia.csv does not mean anything (as it is not generated
for every commit - but only for distribution packages upon new
versions).
