Compiling the program (the easy way)

 ./autoclean.sh
 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make

Optional :
 sudo make install

Now you can run the program : 
 src/heraia filename

If you have installed it : 
 heraia filename

Please note :
If you downloaded the sources from the svn repository the
file heraia.csv does not mean anything (as it is not generated
for every commit - but only for distribution packages upon new
versions).


Code coverage and profiling tests do the following :
 ./configure --enable-gcov --enable-gprof --enable-debug
 make
 ./src/heraia src/heraia

Then do whatever you want and :

 cd src
 lcov -c -o coverage.info --directory=./
 genhtml coverage.info

open index.html generated file with your favorite web browser, and you're done.
